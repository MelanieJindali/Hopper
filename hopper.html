                From a young age Grace Hopper was interested in the way that things worked. She took this love and turned it into an amazing career! By the end of her life she contributed to the world in many ways. She  contributed by teaching mathematics, serving in the US Navy (multiple times) and she made many contributions to the world of computer science, including programming languages, computer bugs and so much more! Overall she was amazing and made great steps forward in the history of computers!

                Fun Fact: Grace Hopper played a role in the first computer bug obstacle - literally, a moth was found in the computer.

            <h2>Important Contributions:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I, a general purpose electromechanical computer used in the war effort during the latter part of WWII.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Was part of the team at Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation that developed the UNIVAC I computer, which was the first large-scale electronic computer on the market in 1950.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developed one of the first compilers, which led to the creation of COBOL, a programming language that is still used today.  COBOL was important because it allowed data processers to use an English-like syntax, rather than numbers and symbols.
