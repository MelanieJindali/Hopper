    <p>Fun Fact: Grace Hopper played a role in the first computer bug obstacle - literally, a moth was found in the computer.</p>



    <h2>Important Contributions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I, a general purpose electromechanical computer used in the war effort during the latter part of WWII.
        </li>
        <li>
            Was part of the team at Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation that developed the UNIVAC I computer, which was the first large-scale electronic computer on the market in 1950.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed one of the first compilers, which led to the creation of COBOL, a programming language that is still used today.  COBOL was important because it allowed data processers to use an English-like syntax, rather than numbers and symbols.
